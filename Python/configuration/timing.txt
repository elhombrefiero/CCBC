# Timing file
#
# Pound signs act as comments
# Script will use this file to build setpoint tables. Time inputs are in seconds.
# Units are degF for Heaters. Units for pumps are gallons for volume.
# No interpolation is done between table entries
# If this file is not filled out properly, the gui table will only have one entry and assume that setpoint at
# time zero.
#
# If a given line matches a component name, the next comma-delimited lines describe the
# timing information for that entry until the script reaches the next entry or the end of file
# The first entry is the time and the second is the set point at that time (in seconds).
# The component name MUST match the name it's trying to drive.
# For example, if component "Heater 1" needs to aim for 75 degF for five minutes, then increase to 120 degF for fifteen
# minutes, then decrease to 100 degF for thirty minutes, the entries would look like so (minus the comment lines):
# Heater 1
# 0,75
# 300,120
# 1200,100
# 3000,100
Heater 1
0.0,32.0
Heater 2
0.0,32.0
Heater 3
0.0,32.0
